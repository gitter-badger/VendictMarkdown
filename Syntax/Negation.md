## Negation

To negate something, add a particle at the end of the word.

Adding ø to anything as a particle instantly negates it, except use 'not' whenever the one being negated in question is a verb.

'Not' can be used as a particle at the end of a noun to express lack.

dʒ or p can be used to add degrees of negation.
