## Changes

Grammar changes depending on the honorific used. Verb endings, conjugation, and pronous may change. Most of the time, only a marking particles is used to denote the honorifics, except for deferencial, blunt and intimate.

~~Planned Changes (thinking up a storm)

Hmmm deferencial should sound as if the listener is at the most importance, maybe change all pronouns and verb endings, might also change certain particles such as articles, evidenciality, classifiers. Word order should also change for each cases. There should be a level of superiority, I don't think that employees or some kind should treat their bosses as if they were kings, I guess if talking to a boss, it should only denote change by article, evidence. Kings or lords should gain all changes.

Now Blunt needs to be as negative as posible, as the same with the deferential honorific, there should be a degree. Keeping the theme of changes, I infer that it would sound as if they were syntax-similar if they kept the same changes for each honorific. Now blunt should use harsher words and make itself as wordy as possible, and posibly trying to reduce all glides.

Polite seems hard to add in, since it feels it should be similar to plain while not being extremely plain. What if I change so little about this honorific that listeners couldn't tell what is the politeness at all! Changes in all pronouns and the "One, I, You" verb endings should be enough to denote between plain and polite.

Intimate, maybe changes in all pronouns, evidence? Oof seems a tad too few, maybe every name gets a marking particle similar to Japanese.
