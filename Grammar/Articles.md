# Articles
In Vendict there are 7 articles, they are used to distinguish between number, gender, animacy, and of course, a general case.

English | Vendict |
--- | --- |
A | Und
The (general) | Tek

These are examples for when adding more specificity to it while adding modifiers.

English | Vendict |
--- | --- |
A (augmented) | Pand
A (diminished) | Dʒunk
The (animated + nonanimated) | Tey
The (male) | Ter
The (female) | Tel

To modify the sounds for the base article must be mutated for it to work. 

Modifer | Change
--- | --- |
Augment | add 'p', mutate vowel to 'a'
Diminish | add 'dʒ', mutate vowel to 'u'
Animacy | add 'y' to the end
Male | add 'r' to the end
Female | add 'l' to the end

This means that they can be stacked against each other to refine the meaning.

For example:

> ENG: The man  
> VDT: Dʒtur  
> GLS: article the male dim/ noun man  

> ENG: The women  
> VDT: Ptar els  
> GLS: article the female aug/ noun women plural 

> ENG: A tree  
> VDT: Dʒundy arbur  
> GLS: article a animate dim/ noun tree
