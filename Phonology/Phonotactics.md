## Phonotactics

When making words, follow this hierachy

Phonome | Letters
--- | ---
Vowels | a, e, i, o, u, æ, œ
Glides | j, w, y
Liquids | l, r
Nasals | n, m
Fricatives | f, h, v, s, z
Stops | t, d, k, g, p, b, c

Sonorants | Obstruents
--- | ---
a, e, i, o, u, æ, œ, l, m, n, ɹ, ɾ, y | b, c, d, f, q, k, p, k^w, r, s, t, v, z, ʒ

Syllable Tree:

Onset > Midian > Rime - Nucleus < Coda
> ex: en > l > i < st

*The rime only refers to the right side of the syllable*  

Basics:
It must start at the bottom of the hierarchy to start the onset, then an optional medial, following sonority reversal rules until it reaches a vowel, in which it must go down, following the same "shape" as onset but in reverse!

Rules:
+ Sonorants and another sonorant cannot cluster unless they are the same sound, then converted to a vowel and a macron
+ Vowels can break the sonority rule and can be clustered. Example: ent**ou**r
+ Obstruents and another obstruent can cluster, except if they are in the same "article of articulation" family
+ Sonority reversals can be done with a limit of one
+ The onset can start with any sound, however it cannot be [y]
+ The onset must be equal or higher
+ The median can be optional and only has glides and liquids
+ Complex onsets cannot have the same sounds
+ No glides in complex onsets
+ Complex codas cannot have the same sounds
+ No glides and liquids in complex codas
+ Glides and liquids cannot ever cluster
+ The ʒ or j glide can break sonority rule
+ ʒ can never be the first or third sound in a syllable and must be bounded to: dʒ, lʒ, and tʒ
