## Cuteness

What makes a sound 'cute'
This research is primarily baised. The base of the research is mainly about appearance, behaviour, and generally, style.

Based on what Kernels percieve as cute.

```
Vowels | a, e, i, o, u
Glides | w, y
Liquids | l, r(Approximant)
Nasals | n
Fricatives | f, h, v, s
Stops | t, k, p
```
### Phonotactical Rules
 * Nasal `m` is not considered cute and must not be used.
 * Liquids, Nasal and Fricatives starts the onset.
 * A glide may form the median. But Liquids cannot.
 * Fricatives and Stops cannot cluster. It must skip directly to the nucleus.
 * Coda must end with a Vowel or Nasal.
 * Must only have 1 or 2 syllables.
