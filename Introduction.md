# Introduction

Vendict is a fictional language created by Trevor Gustavgreen, mainly used to explore languages and linguistics. By the time it is being created, he decided to make it as a full conlang, not merely used to explore languages and such. The setting for this conlang is for those who wish to communicate to other hikers or campers, having a writing system that makes etching the alphabet easier. The language is very specific on location and time, along with numerous words about nature. Since the language can be spoken in higher altitudes, there are 2 modes of phonology, one for daily use and anotherâ€”for speaking it up in higher altitudes. With 9 moods (5 realis and 4 irrealis) there are many words used to express feelings, desires, strong oppinions, surprise, rage, and many others specifically, while having discordant sounds to express anything negative.
